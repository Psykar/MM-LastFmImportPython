    <content><![CDATA[There are four artists sharing this name: 1. An extremely popular and influential British alternative rock group formed in 1991 2. An American psychedelic folk group active in the 70's 3. An alias of American deep house producer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Omar-S" class="bbcode_artist">Omar-S</a> 4. A British classical music group active in the mid-80's  <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><a href="http://www.oasisinet.com" rel="nofollow">British rock band</a>:</span></strong> Oasis is a <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/british">British</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">rock</a> group, originally formed in Manchester, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/United+Kingdom" class="bbcode_place">United Kingdom</a> in 1991. They enjoyed a period of huge success following the release of their first album, Definitely Maybe and during the second, &quot;<a title="Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory%3F" class="bbcode_album">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>&quot;, with praise from across the spectrum and the accumulation of several major awards.  Many critics have since said this was the peak of their musical career to-date.  They cite bands such as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Slade" class="bbcode_artist">Slade</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Stone+Roses" class="bbcode_artist">The Stone Roses</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Real+People" class="bbcode_artist">The Real People</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths" class="bbcode_artist">The Smiths</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who" class="bbcode_artist">The Who</a> as influences.  Oasis has sold 50 million albums worldwide. To date, they have released 7 studio albums, all to hit #1 on the UK album chart!  The band currently comprises lead guitarist and principal songwriter <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Noel Gallagher</a> and his younger brother vocalist/songwriter <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Liam+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Liam Gallagher</a>, who are the only remaining original band members. Included in the group are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Bell" class="bbcode_artist">Andy Bell</a> (formerly of shoegaze band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ride" class="bbcode_artist">Ride</a>), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gem+Archer" class="bbcode_artist">Gem Archer</a>, and drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Chris+Sharrock" class="bbcode_artist">Chris Sharrock</a>, former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Robbie+Williams" class="bbcode_artist">Robbie Williams</a> drummer. The band continues to maintain its original organization of two guitarists, one bassist, drummer, and lead singer.   Thanks to the success of their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;<a title="Oasis - Definitely Maybe" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Definitely+Maybe" class="bbcode_album">Definitely Maybe</a>&quot; and its 18m selling follow-up &quot;<a title="Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory%3F" class="bbcode_album">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>&quot;, the Gallagher brothers featured regularly in tabloid newspaper stories, and cultivated a reputation as bad boys. Berwick Street in London was used for the Album cover of (What's the Story) Morning Glory? <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2005.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2005.php</a>  At the height of their fame, their 1997 third album &quot;<a title="Oasis - Be Here Now" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Be+Here+Now" class="bbcode_album">Be Here Now</a>&quot; reached #1 in the UK charts and also became the fastest-selling album in chart history, with almost half a million copies sold on the first day alone. It also reached #1 in <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/France" class="bbcode_place">France</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Canada" class="bbcode_place">Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Australia" class="bbcode_place">Australia</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Ireland" class="bbcode_place">Ireland</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/place/Japan" class="bbcode_place">Japan</a> as well as #2 in the U.S., just 770 copies short of that week's #1 album. However, the record almost caused the destruction of the band as they experienced an immediate fall in popularity.  Stocks Hotel and Country Club in Hertfordshire was used for the album cover for Be Here Now <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1601.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1601.php</a>  After a three-year break they returned with &quot;<a title="Oasis - Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Standing+on+the+Shoulder+of+Giants" class="bbcode_album">Standing on the Shoulder of Giants</a>&quot; in 2000. Although it was poorly received by critics, it duly gave them their fourth UK #1 album and their fifth UK #1 single with lead single &quot;<a title="Oasis &ndash; Go Let It Out" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/Go+Let+It+Out" class="bbcode_track">Go Let It Out</a>&quot;. Most of the album was recorded by just <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Noel Gallagher</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Liam+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Liam Gallagher</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+White" class="bbcode_artist">Alan White</a> as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+Arthurs" class="bbcode_artist">Paul Arthurs</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Paul+McGuigan" class="bbcode_artist">Paul McGuigan</a> left shortly before its recording.   A new line-up, containing ex-<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ride" class="bbcode_artist">Ride</a> member <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Andy+Bell" class="bbcode_artist">Andy Bell</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Gem+Archer" class="bbcode_artist">Gem Archer</a>, released &quot;<a title="Oasis - Heathen Chemistry" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Heathen+Chemistry" class="bbcode_album">Heathen Chemistry</a>&quot; in 2002, which wasn't well received by the public or the critics. It also hit #1 and contained their sixth UK #1 single in &quot;<a title="Oasis &ndash; The Hindu Times" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/_/The+Hindu+Times" class="bbcode_track">The Hindu Times</a>&quot;, which also topped the Canadian and Italian charts.  <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+White" class="bbcode_artist">Alan White</a>, with the band since &quot;<a title="Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory%3F" class="bbcode_album">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>&quot;, left in 2004 shortly before the recording of the band's sixth album &quot;<a title="Oasis - Don't Believe the Truth" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Don%27t+Believe+the+Truth" class="bbcode_album">Don't Believe the Truth</a>&quot; with rumours suggesting he lacked commitment to the band. He was replaced by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Zak+Starkey" class="bbcode_artist">Zak Starkey</a>, son of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a>' drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Ringo+Starr" class="bbcode_artist">Ringo Starr</a>. &quot;<a title="Oasis - Don't Believe the Truth" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Don%27t+Believe+the+Truth" class="bbcode_album">Don't Believe the Truth</a>&quot; was a huge hit both commercially and (for the first time in a long time for Oasis) critically, hitting #1 and winning a Q award for album of the year, beating <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay" class="bbcode_artist">Coldplay</a>'s &quot;<a title="Coldplay - X&amp;Y" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/X%2526Y" class="bbcode_album">X&amp;Y</a>&quot; amongst others. Sales were over 350,000 in the first week alone and have already broken 1,000,000. Their performances live were also their most consistent in years, as Liam completed all shows. They successfully toured Europe, North America (Canada, USA, Mexico), Asia (Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore) and Australia (Perth, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne).  Through surviving the loss of founding members and with continuous support from their loyal fanbase, Oasis have managed to outlast many of their Britpop contemporaries. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Suede" class="bbcode_artist">Suede</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pulp" class="bbcode_artist">Pulp</a>, and some other peer groups have split up, or record only infrequently, while Oasis maintain a regular schedule of releases and touring. They released a best of compilation entitled &quot;<a title="Oasis - Stop The Clocks" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Stop+The+Clocks" class="bbcode_album">Stop The Clocks</a>&quot; in 2006.   <strong>The Battle of Britpop</strong> A slight setback occured during early sessions for their second album. Original drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tony+McCarroll" class="bbcode_artist">Tony McCarroll</a> was sacked. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Noel Gallagher</a> has since claimed that his departure was a result of him not being technically good enough to play on more complex songs. There were also reports of scuffles with the Gallaghers. McCaroll had been angered by the &quot;£1,000 incident&quot;, as the band called it, which occurred after Creation advanced them that sum to purchase new equipment. Having already spent £600 of his own money on drums, McCaroll was annoyed to find that Noel refused to spend any of the cash on drum skins and instead bought a new guitar. McCaroll was replaced with quiet Londoner <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alan+White" class="bbcode_artist">Alan White</a>, whose brother Steve had drummed for Paul Weller and his band Style Council and many others. McCaroll later attempted to sue the Gallaghers over his sacking, citing breach of contract, but lost the suit on a technicality.  Oasis soon had their first UK #1 with &quot;<a title="Oasis - Some Might Say" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Some+Might+Say" class="bbcode_album">Some Might Say</a>&quot;, the first single from their second album (and the only track on the second album to feature McCarroll), in late April 1995. During this period, the British media seized upon a supposed rivalry between Oasis and fellow Britpop band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur" class="bbcode_artist">Blur</a>. <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Noel+Gallagher" class="bbcode_artist">Noel Gallagher</a> played along, telling The Observer that he hoped <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Damon+Albarn" class="bbcode_artist">Damon Albarn</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alex+James" class="bbcode_artist">Alex James</a> of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur" class="bbcode_artist">Blur</a> would &quot;catch AIDS and die&quot;. He subsequently apologized for this in a formal letter to Melody Maker magazine.  On Monday, August 14, 1995, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur" class="bbcode_artist">Blur</a> and Oasis released new singles on the same day, setting up a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; that dominated the week's music news. Perhaps in part because it was more cheaply priced (£1.99 vs £3.99), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur" class="bbcode_artist">Blur</a>'s &quot;<a title="Blur - Country House" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Country+House" class="bbcode_album">Country House</a>&quot; outsold Oasis's &quot;<a title="Oasis - Roll With It" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Roll+With+It" class="bbcode_album">Roll With It</a>&quot; by 274,000 copies to 216,000 during the week. There was also the difference that &quot;<a title="Blur - Country House" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Blur/Country+House" class="bbcode_album">Country House</a>&quot; was the lead single for a new album, whereas &quot;<a title="Oasis - Roll With It" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Roll+With+It" class="bbcode_album">Roll With It</a>&quot; was the second single off of &quot;<a title="Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory%3F" class="bbcode_album">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>&quot;. Nonetheless, the supposed rivalry has been exploited and rehashed innumerable times in the British press ever since.  In spite of the loss on the singles charts for &quot;<a title="Oasis - Roll With It" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/Roll+With+It" class="bbcode_album">Roll With It</a>&quot;, Oasis's second album, &quot;<a title="Oasis - (What's the Story) Morning Glory?" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Oasis/%28What%27s+the+Story%29+Morning+Glory%3F" class="bbcode_album">(What's the Story) Morning Glory?</a>&quot;, became the second largest selling album of all time in the UK.  <strong>Locations</strong> There is a number of locations around the UK that are associated with Oasis.  John Lennon's childhood home, 251 Menlove Avenue - was used for the sleeve of Oasis single 'Live Forever' <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2015.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2015.php</a>  Berwick street in London was used for the Album cover of '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2005.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2005.php</a>  Cromford Railway Station in Derbyshire was used for the sleeve of Oasis single 'Some might say' <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2012.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2012.php</a>   Liam Gallagher has gotten married twice at the Marylebone Registry Office, to Patsy Kensit in 1997 and on Valentines day the 14th of February 2008 he married his present wife Nicole Appleton. Perhaps one reason is that he is a big Beatle fan and both Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr got married at the Marylebone Registry Office. Liam Gallagher obviously a massive fan of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a> once quoted they are his favorite band, but his favorite modern band are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Floor+monks" class="bbcode_artist">Floor monks</a> <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1109.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1109.php</a>  Regents Park was used for the music video for Liam's track Songbird <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2010.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2010.php</a>  Sifters Records in the Manchester suburb of Didsbury is both mentioned in the lyrics for, and appears in the video of, 'Shakermaker' <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2014.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/2014.php</a>  Stocks Hotel and Country Club was used for the album cover 'Be here now' <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1601.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1601.php</a>  When Noel had first moved to London and before Oasis rose to fame, he used to hang out at the Good Mixer in Camden, the classic Britpop pub. <a href="http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1600.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicpilgrimages.com/articl/1600.php</a>  <strong>Official site:</strong> <a href="http://www.oasisinet.com" rel="nofollow">www.oasisinet.com</a>  <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">American rock band:</span></strong> Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s.
