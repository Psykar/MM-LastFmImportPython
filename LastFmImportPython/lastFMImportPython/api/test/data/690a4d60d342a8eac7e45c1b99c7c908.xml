    <body>hi! i think there should be the possibility for the creator to tag his own published chart images or to file them under tv&amp;films/music (w/ sub-cats)/technics/cartoon/nature/.. how about that? it's a useless waste of serverspace having so many great chart images on last.fm when nobody apart from their creators knows about them!</body>

Pat Metheny also, but again it's more guitars than jazz with trumpet's and sax's (mainly 'cause there's none ;))</body>
