    <content><![CDATA[There are numerous artists using the Nirvana name on Last.fm, 8 are listed in order of prominence:  <strong>1) Nirvana</strong> was a popular and highly influential American <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">grunge</a> band. The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and was part of the Seattle <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/grunge" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">grunge</a> scene of the late 80s. Other Seattle grunge bands such as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Pearl+Jam" class="bbcode_artist">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Alice+in+Chains" class="bbcode_artist">Alice in Chains</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Soundgarden" class="bbcode_artist">Soundgarden</a> also gained in popularity, and, as a result, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/alternative%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">alternative rock</a> became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid '90s.  <strong>Nirvana</strong>'s initial incarnation consisted of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Kurt+Cobain" class="bbcode_artist">Kurt Cobain</a> on guitar and vocals, bassist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Krist+Novoselic" class="bbcode_artist">Krist Novoselic</a>, and drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Chad+Channing" class="bbcode_artist">Chad Channing</a>. After a brief stint as a four-piece in 1989 with the addition of second guitarist <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Jason+Everman" class="bbcode_artist">Jason Everman</a>, followed soon after by the replacement of Channing on drums in 1990, the band found the lineup that would form the core of the group when they added former <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Scream" class="bbcode_artist">Scream</a> drummer <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Dave+Grohl" class="bbcode_artist">Dave Grohl</a>.  As <strong>Nirvana</strong>'s frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;, with <strong>Nirvana</strong> the &quot;flagship band&quot; of &quot;Generation X&quot;. Cobain was uncomfortable with the attention, and placed his focus on the band's music, challenging the band's audience with their much more abrasive third studio album <em><a title="Nirvana - In Utero" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero" class="bbcode_album">In Utero</a></em>, considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While <strong>Nirvana</strong>'s mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band's dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Meat+Puppets" class="bbcode_artist">Meat Puppets</a>, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs <a title="Nirvana &ndash; Oh, Me" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Oh%2C+Me" class="bbcode_track">Oh, Me</a>, <a title="Nirvana &ndash; Plateau" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Plateau" class="bbcode_track">Plateau</a> and <a title="Nirvana &ndash; Lake of Fire" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/Lake+of+Fire" class="bbcode_track">Lake of Fire</a>. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994.  <strong>Nirvana</strong>'s brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band's popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain's death, &quot;<a title="Nirvana &ndash; You Know You're Right" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/_/You+Know+You%27re+Right" class="bbcode_track">You Know You're Right</a>&quot;, an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain's death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of <em><a title="Nirvana - Nevermind" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind" class="bbcode_album">Nevermind</a></em> in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide.  In 2004, the box set &quot;<a title="Nirvana - With the Lights Out" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/With+the+Lights+Out" class="bbcode_album">With the Lights Out</a>&quot;, a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, &quot;<a title="Nirvana - Sliver: The Best of the Box" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Sliver%3A+The+Best+of+the+Box" class="bbcode_album">Sliver: The Best of the Box</a>&quot; was released, a compilation of selected &quot;WTLO&quot; tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous &quot;Fecal Matter&quot; demo.  <strong>Band members</strong>     * Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987–1994)     * Krist Novoselic - bass (1987–1994)     * Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990–1994)  <strong>Prior members</strong>     * Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987–1988)     * Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990)     * Dave Foster - drums (1988)     * Chad Channing - drums (1988–1990)     * Jason Everman - guitar (1989)     * Dan Peters - drums (1990)  <strong>Touring members</strong>     * Pat Smear - guitar (1993–1994)     * Lori Goldston - cello (1993–1994)     * Melora Creager - cello (1994)  ---  <strong>2) Nirvana</strong> is a UK-based <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/progressive%20rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">progressive rock</a> band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day.  The band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably &quot;Rainbow Chaser&quot;, &quot;Pentecost Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Tiny Goddess&quot;) for the fledgling Island Records label.  The band was signed by Island Records' founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Traffic" class="bbcode_artist">Traffic</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Free" class="bbcode_artist">Free</a>.   In October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled <a title="Nirvana - The Story of Simon Simopath" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/The+Story+of+Simon+Simopath" class="bbcode_album">The Story of Simon Simopath</a>. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretty+Things" class="bbcode_artist">The Pretty Things</a>' <a title="The Pretty Things - S.F. Sorrow" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Pretty+Things/S.F.+Sorrow" class="bbcode_album">S.F. Sorrow</a> (December 1968), <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who" class="bbcode_artist">The Who</a>'s <a title="The Who - Tommy" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Who/Tommy" class="bbcode_album">Tommy</a> (April 1969) and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks" class="bbcode_artist">The Kinks</a>' <a title="The Kinks - Arthur" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks/Arthur" class="bbcode_album">Arthur</a> (September 1969).  Musically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/pop" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">pop</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/folk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">folk</a>, <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/jazz" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">jazz</a>, Latin rhythms and <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/classical" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">classical</a> music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity.  The next year 1968 their follow-up album, <a title="Nirvana - All of Us" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/All+of+Us" class="bbcode_album">All of Us</a>, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album <a title="Nirvana - To Markos III" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/To+Markos+III" class="bbcode_album">To Markos III</a> was released on the Pye label in 1969.  In 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two <strong>Nirvana</strong> albums, <a title="Nirvana - Local Anaesthetic" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Local+Anaesthetic" class="bbcode_album">Local Anaesthetic</a> 1971, and <a title="Nirvana - Songs of Love and Praise" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Songs+of+Love+and+Praise" class="bbcode_album">Songs of Love and Praise</a> 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success.  The band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album <a title="Nirvana - Black Flower" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Black+Flower" class="bbcode_album">Black Flower</a> 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album.) In the 1990s two further albums were released. <a title="Nirvana - Secret Theatre" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Secret+Theatre" class="bbcode_album">Secret Theatre</a> 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while <a title="Nirvana - Orange and Blue" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Orange+and+Blue" class="bbcode_album">Orange and Blue</a> 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song &quot;Lithium&quot; originally recorded by the American grunge band <strong>Nirvana</strong> who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original <strong>Nirvana</strong> to continue using its name and issuing new recordings.  In 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled &quot;<a title="Nirvana - Chemistry" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Chemistry" class="bbcode_album">Chemistry</a>&quot; including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material.  Top musicians who played on <strong>Nirvana</strong> sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Spooky+Tooth" class="bbcode_artist">Spooky Tooth</a>.  The group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles" class="bbcode_artist">The Beatles</a> of &quot;<a title="The Beatles - Rubber Soul" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Rubber+Soul" class="bbcode_album">Rubber Soul</a>&quot; and &quot;<a title="The Beatles - Revolver" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Revolver" class="bbcode_album">Revolver</a>&quot;, <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys" class="bbcode_artist">The Beach Boys</a> of <a title="The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/Pet+Sounds" class="bbcode_album">Pet Sounds</a> and <a title="The Beach Boys - God Only Knows" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Beach+Boys/God+Only+Knows" class="bbcode_album">God Only Knows</a>, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Procol+Harum" class="bbcode_artist">Procol Harum</a> of <a title="Procol Harum - A Whiter Shade of Pale" href="http://www.last.fm/music/Procol+Harum/A+Whiter+Shade+of+Pale" class="bbcode_album">A Whiter Shade of Pale</a>, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks" class="bbcode_artist">The Kinks</a> of <a title="The Kinks - Waterloo Sunset" href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Kinks/Waterloo+Sunset" class="bbcode_album">Waterloo Sunset</a>. The majority of the tracks on <strong>Nirvana</strong>'s albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of &quot;progressive rock, soft rock or &quot;orchestral pop&quot;.  Their first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise.  As of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording.  ---  <strong>3) Nirvana</strong> was a short-lived Finnish <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/punk" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">punk</a> band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7&quot; vinyl with tracks &quot;Kielletyt leikit&quot; and &quot;Kuljen kaupungilla&quot; with 200 pressings.  ---   <strong>4) Nirvana 2002</strong> (being converted to just &quot;Nirvana&quot; due to old last.fm moderation system) was a demo-only Swedish <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/death%20metal" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">death metal</a> band active from 1988 - 1991.  ---  <strong>5) Nirvana</strong> was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik. The group consisted of Anthony Moendir, Frits Broekrits and Annie Alberti and have released one single, &quot;Say When&quot;, which became a big hit. The group split up in 1987.  ---  <strong>6) Nirvana</strong> is a side project of <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/The+Skaters" class="bbcode_artist">The Skaters</a>' <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/James+Ferraro" class="bbcode_artist">James Ferraro</a>. Primitive droning drum beats and swirling synthesizers.  ---  <strong>7) Nirvan</strong> Is an Iranian singer/drummer/songwriter. He left Iran in 1997 and moved to Europe when the Iranian government was overthrown. In 1988 he went to Sweden where he met with a local band &quot;The House of Mumbo Jumbo&quot;, a Swedish blues/rock band. <strong>Nirvan</strong> and the band started working together and writing original material. [note: His collaboration with this band is difficult to verify as the only internet search results for &quot;The House of Mumbo Jumbo&quot; link to pages about <strong>Nirvan</strong>.] <strong>Nirvan</strong> moved to the U.S. in June of 1990 and currently resides in Irvine, California. He is a talented drummer and very strong singer and songwriter. <strong>Nirvan</strong>'s first album of original material 'Ba To Bi To' (With You Without You) was released in 2006.c  ---  <strong>8) Nirvana</strong> was a Slovenian <a href="http://www.last.fm/tag/hard-rock" class="bbcode_tag" rel="tag">hard-rock</a> band in the early seventies. They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72).]]></content>
